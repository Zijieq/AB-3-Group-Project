# Domain: Traffic data

### Why are we interested in this field/domain?
> We are interested in this domain because we want to know how traffic has
changed over time. We believe it is relevant for people to know how Washingtonâ€™s traffic has changed so we can find opportunities to improve it.

### What other examples of data driven projects we have found related to this domain?

- One project we found was done by [researchers at the University of Central
Florida partnered with the city of Orlando.](https://www.govtech.com/analytics/Real-Time-Data-Analytics-Aims-to-Reduce-Traffic-Fatalities.html) They utilized
real-time traffic data to find ways to reduce car accidents and to improve
traffic flow in city streets and intersections.

- The second project we found was done by [Texas A&M Transportation Institute](https://mobility.tamu.edu/umr/) titled "Urban Mobility Information."
Their interactive map can display traffic performance
based on factors such as delay per commuter, planning time index,
and annual excess fuel consumed.

- The third project we found was done by Virginia Tech's
[Safe-D program](https://www.vtti.vt.edu/utc/safe-d/index.php/projects/big-data-methods-for-simplifying-traffic-safety-analyses/). Their goal was to provide
bias-correction for traffic datasets that had imbalances, such as unusual zero
or null values for crash data, by using complex statistical methods and
intricate data manipulation.

### What data-driven questions do we hope to answer about this domain?

Three questions we came up with are:
- Which cities and freeways have the worst congestion rates?
- How much has traffic flow changed over 10 years?
- Is there a relationship between collisions and traffic flow?
