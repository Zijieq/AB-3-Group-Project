more collisions, and whether a specific time frame had more/less collisions.
The map could be filtered down to show specific collision severities as well
as date range. Overall we noticed that more traffic collisions occured in
Downtown Seattle area and gradually got less as it moved farther away from
the city. Property Damage Only was the most frequent collision in Seattle."

"Secondly, we wanted to determine the relationship between the weather
and number of collisions. We visualized which weather type had the
most collisions, and broke down the collision numbers by specifying
the severity description of the collision. From the bar plot visualization,
concluded that in all weather types, the most common severity description
was Property Damage Only Collision followed by Injury Collision.
The least common severity description recorded was Fatality Collision.
Among all other weather types, Clear was the weather type that had the
most Property Damage Only Collision, Injury Collision, and Serious Injury
Collision. It was interesting to see that the clear weather type had the
most collisions total and the most serious injury collisions compared to
raining or overcast."

"Lastly, we looked at the relationship between address types and severity
of a collision. In the pie chart, we visualized the percentage of address
types involved in collisions. Using the radio buttons, a user could then
filter which severity of collision they wanted to use to filter the pie chart.
According to the pie chart, the most common severity description reported in
2017 was Property Damage Only Collision followed by Injury Collision.
The least common severity description recorded was Fatality Collision.
Among all other weather types, Clear was the weather type that had the
most Property Damage Only Collision, Injury Collision, and Serious Injury
Collision. It was interesting that the clear weather type had the most
collisions total and the most serious injury collisions compared to raining
